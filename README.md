Project Description: HR Analytics Dashboard

This project involves analyzing employee attrition data to uncover factors that drive turnover within the organization. High attrition rates can be costly, leading to increased recruitment expenses, lost productivity, and disruption in team dynamics. To address this issue, we leveraged data analytics to gain insights into the factors influencing employee departures.

The process started with **data transformation**, where we cleaned and enriched the dataset by creating new columns and categorizing variables for better analysis. After transforming the data, we used **Power BI** to build a comprehensive dashboard, featuring interactive visualizations that highlight key metrics like attrition rates by department, job role, salary level, and demographic factors.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore the impact of factors such as job satisfaction, overtime, work-life balance, and business travel on employee retention. By identifying trends and patterns, the organization can take proactive measures to improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and optimize workforce management.

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support strategic HR decisions, ultimately leading to a more engaged and stable workforce.
